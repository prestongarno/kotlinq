Thanks! And actually I worded that badly - I'm not taking classes at the moment due to financial reasons. I've build/released a few projects to showcase what I can do targeting the area of software development I want to work in (because I'm putting off my degree for the forseeable future). I took your advice and made a LinkedIn and also recently re-worked my resume using what you told me when we went over my last one. I do have a few doubts this time though, about how to effectively present my experience since the majority of my work has been software tooling (i.e. programs that target software and the development process itself). Would you be willing to check out what I have now and let me know your thoughts? If not no worries, I'm pretty confident about hurdling any barrier of entry and landing a job soon with invaluable advice you've given me already!
