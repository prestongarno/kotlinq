## <span style="color:#f442c2">About</span>

This project is a kotlin type-generating [compiler][5] and [runtime][4] 
for type-safe Kotlin DSLs mirroring your [GraphQL][1] API/schema.

## <span style="color:#f442c2">Project goals</span>

Kotlinq has the goal of making GraphQL easy to setup and use in a scalable manner 
while taking advantage of the both pragmatic and type-safe nature of Kotlin. 


Check out obligatory [Hello, world!](hello_world.md) page to see how kotlinq accomplishes this!

## <span style="color:#f442c2">What is GraphQL?</span>

GraphQL is a thoroughly defined [specification][2] which defines
its architecture as structured data conforming to a simple, declarative type system.

GraphQL is a natural way to describe ***data types*** and their ***relationships to other types***
(also known as a graph, where nodes and edges describe a confined set of data). You can learn more
about it [here][3]
